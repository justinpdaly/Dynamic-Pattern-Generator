An interactive web-based pattern generator that creates beautiful geometric patterns through AI-human collaboration using Claude Artifacts.
Features

7 Different Shape Types:

Circles
Squares
Triangles
Stars
Diamonds
Hexagons
Crescents


5 Pattern Variations:

Regular
Alternating Sizes
Wave Motion
Spiral Layout
Cascade


Interactive Controls:

Adjust number of shapes
Control rotation
Modify size
Customize colors
Choose pattern types and variations



Technical Details

Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript implementation
No external dependencies
SVG-based rendering
Responsive design
Interactive hover effects
Real-time pattern updates

Usage

Adjust sliders and inputs to modify pattern parameters
Select different shape types from the dropdown
Try different pattern variations
Use the color pickers to customize the design
Click "Randomize Pattern" for inspiration

Implementation
The pattern generator uses SVG paths and shapes to create complex geometric patterns. Each shape is dynamically generated and positioned based on mathematical calculations. The implementation includes:

Dynamic SVG generation
Mathematical pattern calculations
Interactive controls
Smooth transitions and animations
Hover effects
Randomization features

Development
This project was created through AI-human collaboration using Claude Artifacts, demonstrating the potential of AI-assisted creative coding.
